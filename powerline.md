# Powerline

## Symbols look like `[?]`

Something weird happened -- sometimes this occurs after iTerm update.
Use the `reset-powerline.sh` script found in `dotfiles/powerline/`.

If that doesn't work, try to change the iTerm settings to a different powerline-compatable
font. If this fixes the symbols, remove and reinstall the font files from the powerline/fonts
repo.
