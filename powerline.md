# Powerline

## Symbols look like `[?]`

Usually this hust means there's something wrong with the font.
Sometimes this happens after iTerm beta updates.

First, try to change the iTerm settings to a different powerline-compatable font.

If that fixes the symbols, remove and reinstall the font files from the powerline/fonts repo.
